A discord bot made to learn python and implent what i have learned within the bot. Winter Bot development started in 2019 and was closed as i had no idea what to do. Now i am restarting the project and reworking everthing while making the project open source. 

If you want to use this code to run your own bot, rename the `copy_of_config.json` to `config.json` and fill in your token and stuff to run your bot...figure it out.
U need to do {your_prefix}sync after you run the bot to sync the '/' commands and must do it evertime you add or remove a '/' command, keep in mind its rate-limited but for now no limit to 
update commands.
